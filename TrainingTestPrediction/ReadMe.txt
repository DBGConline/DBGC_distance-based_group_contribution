The code in the directory TrainingTestPrediction is used for training and testing the network in the 
group contribution algorithm and for practical prediction. 

Firstly, the file ANN_therm_group_oneHiddenLayer.m is used to train and test the network. Then the 
trained network will be saved for further prediction. In the pratical prediction, the user can use 
DBGCUseTrainedANN.m, the trained network, and the group contribution vector generated through the 
code in DatabaseGenerator to calculate the standard enthalpy of formation.

To implement this whole process, the .m files ANN_therm_group_oneHiddenLayer.m and DBGCUseTrainedANN.m 
can be used accordingly to speed up the calculation.

----------------------------------
ANN_therm_group_oneHiddenLayer.m
----------------------------------
% This file is used for training and test.
%
% The input file should be put in the directory dataBase, Then the data in the file like 
% dataBase\inputFile_m.xlsx will be imported. Then according to the configuration, the training set 
% and test set will be generated for later training and test.
% 
% The output file is the trained net for further prediction, which is stored as savedNet\parameterizedAlgorithm.mat.
% The figures and error statistics will also be save in the directories Figure or Error.
%
% Tips:
% The random seed is set for reproducibility. A change of the seed would affect the prediction for every single species, 
% but the overall statistic behavior will be hold stable. So it is pointness to only care about only very few cases. It 
% is more meaningful to evaluate the method with the statistic result for large amount of species.
% 
% Generally, the variable regressionTruncate equals to N, and the dimension of the group contribution vector is 
% N*(N+3)/2. However, if the group contribution vector is not directly generated by the code provided, the number 
% of regressionTruncate should be adjusted to represent the number of types of individual groups.

----------------------------------
DBGCUseTrainedANN.m 
----------------------------------
% This file is used for prediction with group contribution vectors.
%
% The input file should be put in the directory DBGCVectors, Then the group contribution vectors in the file like 
% DBGCVectors\DBGCVectors.xlsx will be imported. This code will import the trained net like 
% savedNet\parameterizedAlgorithm.mat and prediction the standard enthalpy of formation of the species in DBGCVectors.xlsx.
% 
% The output will be displayed in the MATLAB output window, which is the variable predicted_test_Y.
