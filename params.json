  "tagline": "This is used to implement distace-based group contribution (DBGC) method",
  "body": "The code is divided into three parts.  \r\n\r\n1.\tThe code in the directory QMCalculation is used to assist quantum chemistry calculation, if users want to prediction the thermodynamic properties for some new species. More details can be found in the \"QMCalculation/ReadMe.txt\" file. If a user has his own script to help with quantum chemistry calculation, this package is not necessary.\r\n\r\n2.\tThe code in the directory DatabaseGenerator is used to generate the database for training, test and prediction. More details can be found in the \"DatabaseGenerator/ReadMe.txt\" file.  \r\n\r\n3.\tThe code in the directory TrainingTestPrediction is used for training and testing the network in the group contribution algorithm and for practical prediction. More details can be found in the \"rainingTestPrediction/ReadMe.txt\" file.  \r\n\r\nCurrently this database, which is stored in the directory Database, has  925 alkanes ranging from C3 to C13, 634 alkenes ranging from C3 to C10, 871 alkyl radicals ranging from C3 to C10, and 1458 alkenyl radicals ranging from C3 to C9. More details can be found in the \"Database/ReadMe.txt\" file.\r\n\r\nTo use the code, python is needed to run .py files, and MATLAB is needed to run .m files.  \r\nA Python distribution, Anaconda, is recommended. Ref: https://www.continuum.io/downloads.  \r\nSome packages are also needed to run the code, including xlrd, xlwt, xlutils, xlsxwriter, openpyxl.  \r\nRef:  \r\nxlrd \thttps://pypi.python.org/pypi/xlrd.  \r\nxlwt \thttps://pypi.python.org/pypi/xlwt.  \r\nxlutils \thttps://pypi.python.org/pypi/xlutils.  \r\nxlsxwriter \thttps://pypi.python.org/pypi/XlsxWriter.  \r\nopenpyxl\thttps://openpyxl.readthedocs.org/en/default/.  \r\nMATLAB is a commercial software.
