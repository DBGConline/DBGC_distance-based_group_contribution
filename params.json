More details can be found in the online \"ReadMe.txt\" file. If user are familiar with quantum chemistry calculation, this package is not necessary.  \r\n2.\tDatabaseGenerator is used to generate the \"database.xlsx\" and \"inputVector.xlsx\" file. For training or test set construction, the code will use the Gaussian output files in directories \"freq\" and \"energy\". For practical prediction, the code will use the geometry files in directory \"Gjfs\". More details can be found in the online \"ReadMe.txt\" file.  \r\n3.\tTrainingTestPrediction is used for training, test and practical prediction. More details can be found in the online \"ReadMe.txt\" file.  \r\n\r\nSome Useful Link:  \r\nGoogle  \r\nhttps://www.google.com/\r\nkeinsci forum  \r\nhttp://bbs.keinsci.com/forum.php\r\nRMG - Reaction Mechanism Generator   \r\nhttp://rmg.sourceforge.net/  \r\n \r\nSome Important Paper:  \r\nS.W.
